      I'm a student at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.digipen.edu.sg/academics/computer-science-degrees/bs-in-computer-science-in-interactive-media-and-game-development" target="_blank">DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore,</a> currently studying Interactive Media and Game Development.
      I was the technical lead for 2 game projects, where I was in charge of designing and integrating code from a team of 6-9 programmers. During my first year, I was on the Provost's List for being the <strong>top 2% of my cohort</strong>.

      As an intern at Kettle Gourmet, I was part of a pioneer team to create games from the ground up. This includes creating the company accounts for Google and Apple, creating accounts on GitHub for version control, and learning the process and requirements of uploading to the Google Play store and iOS App store.

      During my diploma studies, I have used Unity 2D & 3D, Autodesk Maya and Adobe software to design,
      model and script games and released some games on the Google Play store.

      During my free time, I join online game jams regularly hosted on the website Itch.io. So far I have submitted <strong>over 12 games in various game jams</strong> and was one of the top 3 winners in three of them.
